# Multi-Cancer Classification Tool

## Overview
The **Multi-Cancer Classification Tool** is a machine learning-powered web application developed by **DAS medhub** in collaboration with **Team Pinnacle Pioneers**. This tool helps classify different types of cancers based on medical images, providing accurate and quick results that aid medical specialists in diagnosis.

The application uses a TensorFlow.js model hosted on GitHub and can be accessed via a simple web interface. Users can upload medical images, and the model will predict the cancer type based on its training.

### Developed By:
- **DAS**- Medhub (healthtech start-up)
- **Team Pinnacle Pioneers**

## Features
- **Multi-Cancer Classification:** Supports classification for several cancer types such as:
  - Brain Glioma
  - Breast Malignant
  - Cervix Koc
  - Lung SCC
  - Oral SCC
  - And many more...
  
- **Web-based Inference:** No need for specialized hardwareâ€”simply upload an image to the web app, and the prediction is made directly in the browser using TensorFlow.js.
  
- **Fast and Efficient:** The model processes medical images quickly, providing predictions within seconds.

## Model Architecture
The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically fine-tuned using the **Resnet50** model. This model has been trained on a dataset of multi-cancer images to detect different types of cancers with high accuracy.

Key Components:
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extracts features from input images.
- **Batch Normalization:** Stabilizes learning by normalizing layer inputs.
- **Dropout:** Reduces overfitting by randomly ignoring some neurons during training.
- **Dense Layers:** Provides classification decisions.

## Installation & Setup

### Requirements
- **TensorFlow.js** (for client-side inference)
- A browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Internet connection (for loading the model from GitHub)

### Running Locally

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sebukpor/multi-cancer.git
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

3. Upload an image and press **Predict**. The model will classify the image and display the predicted cancer type.

### Hosting on GitHub Pages
To host the tool on GitHub Pages:
1. Push the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Go to the repository settings and enable GitHub Pages in the "Pages" section.
3. The tool will be hosted at: `https://sebukpor.github.io/multi-cancer`.

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the tool in a browser (hosted online or locally).
2. Click the **Upload Image** button to upload a medical image.
3. After uploading, click **Predict**.
4. The result will be displayed on the screen, indicating the predicted cancer type.

## Model Details

- **Input Size:** The model expects images of size **224x224** pixels.
- **Number of Classes:** The model classifies images into the following 26 cancer types:
  - `All Benign`
  - `All Early`
  - `Brain Glioma`
  - `Breast Malignant`
  - `Lung SCC`
  - ... (list all cancer types)
  
- **Model Format:** The model is in TensorFlow.js format (`model.json` and corresponding weight files).

## Data Preprocessing
The images are preprocessed using the following techniques:
- **Resizing:** All images are resized to 224x224 pixels.
- **Normalization:** Pixel values are scaled to the range [0, 1].

## Dataset
The model has been trained on a custom dataset that includes labeled images for multiple cancer types. The dataset includes images of:
- **Brain Cancer**
- **Breast Cancer**
- **Lung Cancer**
- **Oral Cancer**
- And more...

### Data Augmentation
To improve model robustness, the following augmentations were applied:
- **Rotation**
- **Zooming**
- **Horizontal Flipping**

## Model Training
- **Architecture:** Resnet50-based CNN.
- **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer with a learning rate of `1e-4`.
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Cross-Entropy.
- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Training Time:** 5 epochs (you can adjust based on your needs).

## Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy:** X%
- **Precision:** X%
- **Recall:** X%
- **F1-Score:** X%
